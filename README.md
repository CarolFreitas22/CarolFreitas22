- 👋 Hi, I’m Jessica Carolinbe
- 👀  I'm interested in being a technology professional
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to use git hub, networks and phython.
- 💞️ I want you to be with me and I want to be with you at the beginning of my journey in this area.
- 📫 How can you help me? You can send me tips and courses aimed at development and programming languages, the rest I try to unroll and develop.
